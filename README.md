Purpose
This assignment is designed to enhance your skills in pre-processing and analysing social data.
Your task involves pre-processing and analysing tweets obtained from three Twitter accounts.
The analysis encompasses scoring tweets for sentiment, constructing a word corpus, generating
a Term Document Matrix, plotting a Word Cloud, and creating an appropriate visual
representation that shows the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative tweets for each Twitter
account. The findings of the analysis should be documented within a comprehensive report, as
outlined in the "Assignment Deliverables" section below.
Problem Statement
Your objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets from three distinct yet related Twitter
accounts utilizing RStudio. You have the flexibility to select tweets from one of the specified
groups given below:
1. Universities or Polytechnics (Whitireia, Wintec, and Tai Poutini)
2. Political Parties (Labour, National, and the Greens)
3. Utility Companies (Contact, Genesis, and Meridian)
4. Media Outlets (Newstalk ZB, RNZ, and RadioLIVE)
5. Fast Food Chains (McDonald’s, Burger King, BurgerFuel)
6. Petrol Companies (BP, Mobil, and Z Energy)
Analyse each of the three Twitter accounts within your chosen group in accordance with the
instructions detailed in the Tasks section below. Additionally, it is imperative to compare the
results of your analysis for each Twitter account to discern common themes or significant
disparities between the organizations under investigation. The deliverables for this assignment
consist of a comprehensive report and the R script utilized to conduct the analysis.
Tasks
• Import tweets into RStudio from three specified Twitter accounts, as outlined in the
Problem Statement section above.
• Pre-process the raw tweets (Remove URLs, hashtags, control codes, punctuation, etc).
Ensure that only regular English words remain after data cleansing.
• Conduct sentiment analysis on the cleaned tweets to identify the tweet with the highest
emotional content in categories such as 'fear,' 'joy,' 'sadness,' etc. Analyse these tweets
to determine the words indicative (suggestive) of each emotional category.
• Perform sentiment analysis to classify each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.
Identify the most negative and positive tweets and provide insights into why the
algorithm considered them particularly positive or negative.
• Create an appropriate visual representation illustrating the proportion of tweets
categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.
4
• Generate a Term Document Matrix (TDM) from the extracted tweets, including words
between 5 and 15 characters in length. Select appropriate stop words based on tweet
content, remove numbers, and convert all words to lowercase.
• Utilize the TDM details (and any additional required processing) to create a Word Cloud
that contains approximately 50 commonly appearing words within tweets. Identify the
most frequently occurring word in the cloud and compare it with the most frequently used
word in the tweets from other analysed Twitter accounts. Determine any words
commonly used across all accounts. For each of the Twitter accounts you have selected,
determine what other words are correlated with the three most frequently occurring
words in each Word Cloud.
• Prepare a comprehensive analysis report documenting the findings and observations
from the above tasks. Present all analysis results, including tables, graphs, and Word
Clouds. Compare findings across the analysed Twitter accounts, highlighting similarities,
common themes, and differences. Provide insights into what these results convey about
the organizations under investigation.
Assignment Deliverables
Each student is required to submit the R code and analysis report bundled as a single zip file.
1. R Code: An R script containing all the code utilized for tweet processing. The script
should include comprehensive comments clarifying the tasks performed. Before
submission, ensure to clear all objects/variables and plots from your R Studio workspace
using the 'sweeping brush' icons, then rerun your script to ensure its functionality on my
machine.
2. Analysis Report
a. An executive summary providing an overview of the analysis.
b. Detailed explanations of the objectives for each stage of tweet analysis.
c. Presentation of results from each stage of analysis for each Twitter account,
incorporating visualizations such as tables, graphs, and Word Clouds.
d. Interpretation of analysis results, addressing the tasks outlined above.
e. Comparison of results obtained from the Twitter accounts.
f. A conclusion section summarizing key insights gained from analysing the Twitter
accounts.
